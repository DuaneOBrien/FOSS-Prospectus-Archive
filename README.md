# FOSS-Prospectus-Archive
A collection of publicly available prospectuses for Free and Open Source Foundations, Events, and Projects 

## What Is This Repo About
My goal is to collect sponsorship prospectuses that have been used in the FOSS Community for the past 20 years.

Free and Open-Source Software depends heavily on the community participation. One way companies participate in the community is by sponsoring foundations, events, and open source projects. But we don't have a good historical overview of how spending and funding has evolved over time. 

Having all of this information together in one place can serve several purposes:
 * Inspiration for people who are trying to put together a prospectus for their own efforts;
 * Reference material for funding research initiatives;
 * Transparency;

## Contributing To This Repository
If you have or know where to find a prospectus, we invite your to submit a PR to add the file to this repo. Please review the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on how to contribute to this repository.

Check [Issues](issues) for a list of prospectuses we hope to find. 


## Hacktoberfest Participation
For the purposes of Hacktoberfest, we will only mark a PR "hacktoberfest-accepted" if that PR adds a new prospectus to the repo, or if it addresses an issue with the  "hacktoberfest" label. PRs that make non-substantive changes to project documentation will be closed and marked as spam.
